# less.ly Python Utilities


This is a set of Python utilities I frequently reuse. Some make more sense than others. Some are very harmful and Should Not Be Used. Others are great. Many I've collected from around the internet, and tweaked to my taste. Most I've written. No, I can't tell which is which any more.

Your mileage may vary.
